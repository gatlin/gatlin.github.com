<h3>... as a programmer</h3>

<p>I'm an experienced and motivated software developer. I enjoy working on hard
problems and with great people. I've worked on web applications and systems
applications personally and professionally.</p>

<p>I want to help you create things you didn't think you could create. I want
to help you streamline your business, fix some personal peeve, or make something
that has never existed before.</p>

<p>If you want a quirky Scotty to your Kirk, drop me a line at <a href="&#x6D;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x74;&#x6F;:&#114;&#x6F;&#107;&#101;&#110;&#x72;&#x6F;&#x6C;&#64;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;">&#114;&#x6F;&#107;&#101;&#110;&#x72;&#x6F;&#x6C;&#64;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;</a>.</p>

<p>Hell, the content management system I'm using for this site was a little
<a href="/static/mksite.pl.txt">15 minute script</a> I wrote. "If the women don't find you
handsome, they should at least find you handy." -- Red Green.</p>

<h3>... as a tutor</h3>

<p>I'm still in college, but I'm only taking one class and it's my last semester.
I really enjoy computer science and higher level math. I've taken courses in
linear algebra, vector calculus, discrete math, programming languages (design
and implementation), propositional logic, and even creative writing. If you want
a fun, friendly tutor for a rather cheap price, let me know!</p>

<h2>... i also do weddings</h2>

<p>Seriously. I'm a licensed inter-faith / secular minister with the Universal
Life Church. I work for cheap and have a good speaking voice and a Moses-esque
beard. If you live in central Texas and need a cheap, eccentric minister, then
really why the hell not? Statistically, it'll be a short-lived mistake anyway.</p>
