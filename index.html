                        <p>
                            I'm a software developer in sunny Austin, TX.
                            Graduated from UT with my BS in Computer Science. I
                            do freelance development and hide in academia.
                            Research interests include machine learning, logic
                            programming, math education, and vodka.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I live in and support cooperatives, play classical
                            guitar, and watch a lot of bad movies.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Hire me!</h3>
                        <p>I enjoy designing and making software. If you want
                        me to make some software, or want to work with me on
                        something, drop me a line. <a

                    <div class="span12">
                        <p>If you're an investor or employer, you should know
                        I'm a brilliant, witty savant who is super driven to
                        take over the world with you. Check out my LinkedIn up
                        top!</p>

                        <p>Everyone else: Hi! Welcome. I try to keep an open
                        mind and I hate working on things that aren't
                        interesting, or purely driven by money. I'm not going
                        to help optimize spammy conversion pages, I'm not going
                        to A/B test basic human greetings, etc. Really cool
                        things come out of love, so you need to love what you
                        do.</p>

                        <p>In high school I did competitive literary criticsm.
                        They actually gave me a letter jacket for my feats. I
                        can't decide how cool this makes me.</p>

                        <p>I was kind of bad at math in high school and only
                        chose computer science because I had this notion that
                        if I'm going to be paying (yes, I) for school by
                        selling organs, I'd better get my money's worth. So I
                        picked something I wasn't fantastic at.</p>

                        <p>Fast forward. I've tried veganism, brewed kombucha,
                        volunteered for festivals, learned to play FÃ¼r Elise
                        behind my head, been on the board of directors of two
                        cooperative systems in Austin, and kissed a stingray.
                        In my spare time I read math papers and teach on a
                        volunteer basis. Turns out I wasn't bad at math; I was
                        just uninspired. Seeing the world a bit, and in various
                        states of mind, has been fantastic for realizing
                        what's important.</p>

                        <p>Which is why I'm not going to sit at a desk and scam
                        people.</p>
