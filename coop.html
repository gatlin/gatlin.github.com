            <h1>Cooperation for fun and (not-for) profit</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Many people hear <em>cooperative</em> and think of different things. Some think of
radical hippie and/or religious communes; some think of REI. Cooperation is
more a set of principles than a specific implementation or use and this is a
good thing.</p>

<p>Worker cooperatives exist to protect the rights of the employees of a business
by allowing the employees to democratically make decisions about the board,
what to do with profits, and company policy. Consumer cooperatives exist to
allow consumers to have economic strength in numbers.</p>

<p>Housing cooperatives are a different class of thing, because they are
not-for-profit. The goal of a cooperative housing organization is affordable
rent for tenants and democratic control for the tenants over the finances and
activities of the organization.</p>

<p>See a pattern here?</p>

<p>I live in the great state of Texas, and so the following guide is most
applicable there. However, there are similar statutes and provisions in other
states which allow for similar schemes.</p>

<p>I say "scheme" because what I am about to propose is counter to the way of life
with which most people are accustomed. I'm talking about a mutually respectful,
labor-centered existence; an existence where a person's value is not measured
in dollars, and where Capital has been dethroned; a life post-rat-race.</p>

<p>So, let's get this party started.</p>

<h2>Who the Hell are you?</h2>

<p>I'm Gatlin Johnson; this is my website. I currently reside in cooperative
housing and have been on the Board of Directors of College Houses, Inc.
Currently, I coordinate the labor at a 100+ person house in Austin, TX.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of cooperatives and I really believe that the cooperative
movement provides solutions to a lot of problems we face socially and
politically. If the banks are screwing you, switch to a credit union. If you're
sick of your land-lord, become your own land-lord. Want better food at your
super market? Join a food co-op and vote.</p>

<p>The list goes on. Group equity housing, as will be described in this document,
is but one way of structuring a housing cooperative. I think it is the best
model to empower the disenfranchised and poor because <em>expansion only lowers
rent</em>.</p>

<p>Hopefully this guide will be useful for you. If you have any questions,
comments, or concerns, please send me a letter at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#x6F;:&#x72;&#x6F;k&#101;&#110;&#x72;&#x6F;&#x6C;&#x2B;&#99;&#111;&#111;p&#64;&#103;&#x6D;a&#x69;l&#x2E;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#x72;&#x6F;k&#101;&#110;&#x72;&#x6F;&#x6C;&#x2B;&#99;&#111;&#111;p&#64;&#103;&#x6D;a&#x69;l&#x2E;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

<h2>What is a co-op?</h2>

<p>In general, a co-op is owned by its members. Aside from any other details, that
is the most important quality. We can get a little more specific, though.</p>

<h3>Rochdale</h3>

<p>There is a set of 7 principles, called the <em>Rochdale Principles</em>, which are
generally agreed upon to be the guidelines to which cooperatives should aspire:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Voluntary and open membership. Cooperatives are open to anyone who wants to
join, full stop.</p></li>
<li><p>Democratic member control. Members are active in setting policy and making
decisions as a group. It is up to the group itself to decide exactly how
this should work; some groups use simple majority, some are consensus, and
still others operate differently.</p></li>
<li><p>Member economic participation. Members contribute equitably (perhaps
proportionately according to some standard or absolutely equally) and decide
democratically what to do with funds.</p></li>
<li><p>Autonomy and independence. At all costs, in any relationship with any
governmental or non-governmental entity, the organization maintains
democratic member control and never cedes this control for any reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Education, training, and information. The cooperative should provide
education and training for their members so that everyone can contribute
effectively. The organization is a human one; it should help humans grow and
learn.</p></li>
<li><p>Cooperation among cooperatives. Strength in numbers!</p></li>
<li><p>Concern for community. No man is an island; a cooperative organization
should be concerned for the welfare of its community, however broadly or
narrowly defined.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You may read more about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles" title="Rochdale Principles">Rochdale Principles here</a>. In general, though,
this summary gets the gist across. It is important to remember that nothing
legally obliges you to follow these rules but (anecdotally) they do result in
functioning houses.</p>

<h3>Group equity</h3>

<p>The specific kind of cooperative I will be writing about is a <em>group-equity</em>
organization.</p>

<p>In a group-equity scenario, the financial value of the organization stays in
the organization and is not paid back out to members. Instead, the spirit of
the organization is to take the value it accumulates and aggressively try to
lower rent, provide more services, and generally work even harder in the
interests of the members. Democratic member control ensures that this happens.</p>

<p>Other kinds of cooperatives are more familiar: the amount given to the
cooperative is paid back (with some kind of added amount) to the member if the
member chooses to leave; or, dividends may be paid directly to the member. This
is attractive to any self-interested entity for obvious reasons. The problem,
though, is that this does not poise the organization for growth.</p>

<p>Another problem with other models is liability: what happens when someone gets
hurt on property directly owned by you? You are potentially opened up to
lawsuits and insurance nightmares. This sounds awful.</p>

<p>Group equity, then, maintains a strong financial core within the organization,
and all shared property is technically owned by the organization. This provides
protection from liability and makes the organization easier to maintain. The
downside is that investments are not paid back directly, but through services.</p>

<p>The win with group equity is that the organization benefits from expansion. But
we are getting ahead of ourselves here. Additionally, shared bank accounts and
bulk purchasing are easier when only one entity (legally) has control.</p>

<h3>Democratic control</h3>

<p>This sounds like a nightmare, of course. If you can barely schedule a lunch
with 4 friends, how can you run a large housing group?</p>

<p>The first step, of course, is not to be a <em>large</em> housing group. College
Houses, Inc of Austin, Texas (the cooperative with which the author is
best-acquainted) has 6 different houses. 5 of them have 100+ or more members.
In general, this number proves to be effective; the author would discourage a
house from aspiring to any more. Most other houses this author has encountered
have around 20 members. Many have fewer.</p>

<p>The organization itself is rather huge but, just as with federal and state
governments, at a certain threshold new layers of government are added for
efficiency. Yes, I said "government" and "efficiency" in the same sentence.</p>

<p>Houses tend to elect leadership positions charged with varying amounts of
responsibility. The spirit is not to endow people with power over others, but
to serve the rest of the house. Many houses even call the keystone leader
"Trustee." ("Director" is also common but that sounds so depressing, doesn't
it?).</p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances of the house, there are a number of options
available, which will be discussed. Houses tend to have labor managers,
maintenance coordinators, groundskeepers, chefs, and many other positions
chosen straight from the membership itself. Depending on how many people are in
your individual house, you can create more or fewer positions.</p>

<h3>Meetings</h3>

<p>Houses also tend to hold meetings twice or four times a month. House policy is
typically discussed, created, amended, or redacted at these meetings.
Additionally, these meetings serve as a general forum for issues facing the
house.</p>

<p>It is customary to require any proposed changes to house policy to be posted a
day or two before the meeting; this is up to the house to decide in its bylaws.</p>

<h3>Hierarchy</h3>

<p>Many cooperatives seem to frown on hierarchy, and in the case of a housing
co-op it really has no place.</p>

<p>However, sometimes (for example) a maintenance coordinator will have a
maintenance crew and the coordinator will hand out assignments to the crew.
This is an administrative convenience. While a great number of atrocities have
been committed in the spirit of efficiency and consolidation, many houses
permit any member to have an officer reviewed for any reason. Thus, everyone
has a check on everyone else. If the house is laid back and fun then members
should rarely have to resort to this kind of action.</p>

<h3>Labor</h3>

<p>Cooperatives are said to be more "laborist" than "capitalist." While a capital
investment is generally required in order to make the house function, the
primary goal of a housing cooperative is to make this capital investment as low
as possible.</p>

<p>Houses tend to have labor requirements, such as washing dishes or cooking or
mopping or any number of other menial or administrative tasks. This is the true
power of cooperation: the members rely on each other to run the house as
opposed to paying external entities. This strengthens the financial position of
the house and allows the members to keep costs down. It also inspires a
camraderie among members which is hard to quantify.</p>

<p>If you are skeptical of this, consider that College Houses has 532 members at
the time of writing. The organization is managed at an adminstrative level by 5
paid staff. Roughly 19% of organizational revenue goes to the staff.</p>

<h3>Officers</h3>

<p>There is a fine line to be walked between a completely flat, honor-based system
of operations and a rigid authoritarian dystopia. Many houses create officers
whose stature may be challenged at any time.</p>

<p>A house typically has the following positions. Note that these are only
suggestions but they do work well.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trustee. The Trustee has the vaguest but arguably most important job:
ensuring that the co-op is healthy and operational. The Trustee oversees
other officers in their duties, helps mediate disputes among members, and
tries to improve the house.</p></li>
<li><p>Labor Coordinator. Many houses choose the cheeky alternative "Labor Czar,"
and yours truly likes it more. The Labor Czar coordinates what labor
assignments need to be done, appropriate compensation, and who will be
doing it. They do not have control per se but typically they are empowered
to make reasonable and fair executive decisions about who will be doing
what.</p></li>
<li><p>Kitchen Manager. A co-op typically has a very large kitchen, and a large
store of foods. Many times the kitchen has industrial sinks, grills,
sanitizers, and similar equipment because technically the kitchen has to be
up to local health codes. The Kitchen Manager ensures that the kitchen is
stocked, equipped, clean, and functional. No small feat.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintenance Coordinator. Get someone who knows how to fix the majority of
things that can go wrong in a house, and who doesn't mind being dirty, and
elect them to this position.</p></li>
<li><p>Treasurer. We manage our finances in a college-ruled notebook somewhere.
This doesn't have to be fancy.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The emphasis thus far has been to explain the more quantifiable and objective
properties of co-ops. It is one thing to say that co-ops are fun and bring a
real sense of community; it is another to demonstrate a financial model which
scales well and provides useful services to its members.</p>

<h2>How do I start one?</h2>

<p>Cooperatives are very tricky. The first step, of course, is to have a
community. This might be the single hardest thing to do simply because many
people have to need housing at the same time for it to work. This is why
cooperatives have been so successful among students: you have a predictable
cycle of people coming and going.</p>

<p>Once you have a community, though, it gets a little easier. The Texas Business
Organizations Code, Title 6 Chapter 251 Outlines the legal basis for creating
"cooperative associations." Let us take a look at what a cooperative
association is.</p>

<h3>Cooperative basis and the legal foundations</h3>

<p>It is best to go ahead and become an official cooperative association legally,
for a number of reasons. Chief among them include liability shielding and
simplified finances.</p>

<p>Additionally, this puts you in a good place to go to an organization like
<a href="http://nasco.coop" title="North American Students of Cooperation">NASCO</a> or a credit union and request assistance - both legally and
financially.</p>

<p>According to the official definitions, a cooperative association may accumulate
savings and retain them at the organizational level to reduce charges to
patrons, expand services, or just act in accordance with the organizational
charter.</p>

<p>This is what is known as a "cooperative basis." Dividends may be paid to each
individual member or to the organization itself, which means group equity is
completely legal.</p>

<p>Additionally, provisions from the code governing non-profits also apply to
cooperative associations. However, the rules of cooperative associations
explicitly trump the provisions for non-profits. So, we will only delve into
non-profit rules if we strictly have to here.</p>

<p>To start a cooperative association, the following information must be filed
with the Secretary of State:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name of the entity being formed;</li>
<li>The type of filing entity being formed;</li>
<li>The purpose for which the filing entity is formed;</li>
<li>The duration (you should just say "perpetually");</li>
<li>The street address of the initial registered office and the name of the
person at the office;</li>
<li>The name and adress of each filing entity;</li>
<li>Whether the coop is organized with or without shares (that's "no") here;</li>
<li>The number of shares or memberships (irrelevant);</li>
<li>The method of distribution on winding up and termination of any surplus of
the cooperative association; and</li>
<li>The names and street addresses of the directors who will manage the affairs
of the coop for the initial year.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's quite a large pill to swallow. Even worse, the Secretary of State
website does not provide a form for this. However, the <a href="http://nasco.coop" title="North American Students of Cooperation">form for
non-profits</a> can serve as inspiration for whatever document you create.</p>

<p>It'll only cost $25, though, if that makes you feel better.</p>

<p>Now we will go over some of the nit-picky details of cooperative associations
and the weird sorts of things you have to do.</p>

<h3>Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws</h3>

<p>The Articles of Incorporation are the forms you file with the state to form the
cooperative. They specify the information detailed in the previous section and
really whatever else you want. However, changing Articles of Incorporation can
be difficult and expensive because it requires a vote and a filing fee. What
you should do instead is mention in your articles that day-to-day operations
are specified in bylaws maintained by the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>And that's where the Bylaws come in.</p>

<p>The Bylaws need to specify everything about how your organization is run. What
positions are there on the board? How long do they serve? How do you handle new
member applications? What rights do members have? What constitutes a "majority"
in a vote? What subdivisions of the organization are there?</p>

<p>The list can go on endlessly, but in practice efficient sets of bylaws are
possible. As is usual with this document, I refer you to <a href="http://collegehouses.org/about/operations/bylaws.html" title="CH Bylaws">the College Houses,
Inc, bylaws</a>.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at some of what they do.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Purpose
This is very important for legal reasons. It also serves to focus the
organization. Never underestimate the importance of a mission statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Membership meetings
Who, what, where, when, and how. The "why" is implicit.</p></li>
<li><p>Board of Directors
This is a really huge part. Notice the detail and especially notice how
they plan for the worst (ie, directors leaving, ousting them, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Positions
How the Board itself actually functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Employees
Not everyone in the corporation is a member, and it's good to specify when
and how salaried employees are managed. Let it be known, though, that you
open yourself up to a number of legal headaches when doing this. Best skip
it for now.</p></li>
<li><p>How committees work
In practice, the most important three committees are three that are not
specified in the bylaws. However, Article IX, Section 1 allows for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Money stuff
When does the fiscal year start? When can the corporation hoard money? When
can the corporation spend money? Notice the lack of officious language,
too.</p></li>
<li><p>Amendments
Possibly the most important part of the bylaws: the rules by which the
bylaws themselves are amended. Don't skimp on this one.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think the most important take-away is how clean and concise the language is.
This is not legal weasel-ese, it is language by humans and for humans. So,
don't feel like you must affect some odd stuffy Victorian writing style.</p>

<h3>Board of Directors</h3>

<p>You must have a Board of Directors because technically you are a legal entity.
This may not be obvious simply because you wanted to buy a house, not create
some kind of business with a board and all that crap. Fret not!</p>

<p>The legal requirements for a board are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>There must be 5 directors;</li>
<li>No director may serve more than 3 continuous years;</li>
<li>Directors are directors until expunged (as provided by the bylaws) or
replaced in an election;</li>
<li>The number of directors may be divvied among arbitrary parts of the
organization;</li>
<li>An executive committee may be elected if specified in the bylaws.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Board is technically the actual legal steward of the cooperative, even if
that's not in the spirit of your house. That's fine; deprive them of whatever
powers you don't want them to have in your bylaws.</p>

<p>Once elected (or, right after the cooperative is formed), the Board must elect
officers. The default officers provided by law are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A president;</li>
<li>A secretary and a treasurer or a secretary-treasurer;</li>
<li>one or more vice-presidents.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can, however, make up whatever you want. Several organizations have Chair
of the Board in place of President. College Houses has a Chair, a Secretary,
and a Treasurer.</p>

<p>Note also that the Board does not have to consist solely of members of the
organization. Again citing College Houses, you can have special positions for
interested community members.</p>

<p>What I suggest you do if you only have one house in your cooperative is to make
elected leadership positions in your house automatically be board members.
Houses typically have multiple officer positions anyway and this keeps things
relatively simple.</p>

<p>If you have multiple houses, it might be best to actually give the board some
power. At two or more houses, the board <em>is</em> useful for inter-house
coordination. There will be budget concerns applicable to the whole
organization, purchasing decisions which affect all the members, and maybe even
shared coffers which individual houses might want to dip into.</p>

<p><strong>The take away:</strong> if it's just you and a few buddies, write the board into
your bylaws as a ceremonial legal necessity. If you start expanding, make use
of the board since you have to have it anyway.</p>

<h3>More to come!</h3>

<p>This document will have more to follow. As I learn more I will update it here.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions or comments send a message to
