                          Labor is your share of the work necessary to operate the house. This typically requires 4-5 hours per week by each person at the house. Opsis does not require as much. Whatever is done at your home is done at the co-op. Cooking, cleaning, doing dishes, mopping, minor maintenance, etc., are all part of the system. The first two weeks are flexible in that you sign up based on your schedule. By that time, schedules are set and then you will be assigned permanent duties for the balance of the semester. While some flexibility is allowed, it is critical that you come prepared to do what is assigned.

                          Living in a co-op is great. You have the opportunity to meet a lot of people and form strong friendships. You have control of your house and your money, and the ability to affect real change. There is always something to do, and you usually have different things to choose from. The houses are close to campus and to each other, so you really feel like you are part of a community. You put in some labor, but it's less than if you lived by yourself and had to cook and clean everything all the time. If you are quiet or not very social, then you can keep to yourself and still benefit from the cooperative system. If you are social, then you will meet a lot of great people.

                          Well, no. Sometimes a meal just doesn’t turn out right, or maybe the cooks didn’t prepare enough of something. Or maybe someone didn’t do their labor and that affected something else. But that is why there are regular house committee meetings that you should participate in to help solve house problems when they arise.
