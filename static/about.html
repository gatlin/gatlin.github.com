          <h1>What is College Houses?</h1>
          <hr>
          <p class='well'>College Houses is a housing co-op. But what is a
          cooperative?</p>

          <h2>Cooperatives</h2>
          <p>A cooperative is a very special form of business ownership in which the
          users or providers of a good or service own and control the
          organization that provides it for them.</p>

          <p>Co-ops operate according to principles, the so called Rochdale
          principles, named for 27 weavers in Rochdale, England, who in 1844
          opened the first modern consumer's cooperative on Toad Lane. For a
          year they saved their money and then pooled it to open their business
          based on the principles they had developed.</p>

          <p>That is what we do here at College Houses. The membership pools
          its money and labor to provide shelter, amenities, food, fellowship
          and an academic environment. The consolidation of member efforts
          results in affordable housing and a living environment that teaches
          life skills for the future. (Like learning how to cook for a
          hundred.) Incorporating the six Rochdale principles into our daily
          lives and the way we operate gives us the foundation to operate as a
          cooperative.</p>

          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <img src="img/ch/stonehenge.jpg" class="well" />
          <p>The original College House was formed in 1964 as a student
          government project with help from a sustaining grant by the Hogg
          Foundation. The purpose was to create a housing facility for
          University students with many of the features of a residential
          college. College Houses was to have the convenience of a dormitory
          with a rich program of intellectual activities.</p>

          <p>In many ways, the College House organization worked well for a
          number of years. College House was known as a place where discussions
          were held between students, faculty, and community people. We had a
          resident faculty professor and his family lived with us from the
          years 1964 to 1972. During the 60's, we had a very diverse community
          and it became known as a gathering place for radicals even though we
          had people on both sides of the radical/conservative fence.</p>

          <p>Until 1969, we continued the original system of having an outside
          business provide the housing and food services. Costs for housing and
          food were climbing and we needed a cheaper alternative. As we
          gradually increased our own work load to run the house, the academic
          orientation lost some of its focus. In 1973, with a HUD loan, we
          purchased our first two buildings and built the 21st St. facility. In
          1983 we added the last two.</p>

          <p>Since 1964, College Houses membership has grown tremendously. What
          began as an experiment for a small number of student scholars to
          interact with faculty and staff has evolved into a housing
          cooperative that seeks to provide a unique living experience for its
          400 plus members' at the most affordable price. We have survived the
          Austin real estate ups and downs and now have a strong cooperative
          community providing every necessity for the college student in an
          environment that the members control and enjoy.</p>
