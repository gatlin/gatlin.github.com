<p>Let's say you had a programming language that didn't support Boolean values, Boolean operators, or <code>if</code> syntax natively. What would you do?</p>
<p>Most people would go find another language. Some folks (including yours truly) would maybe adopt a different programming style for that language. But there is a third option:</p>
<p>write your own.</p>

<p>I'm going to demonstrate how to do this in perfectly valid R6RS Scheme (Racket, specifically). Hopefully it will be illuminating.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-data-type"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Creating the data type</h2>
<p>Racket doesn't have static typing or algebraic data types but we can make pretend like so:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode scheme"><code class="sourceCode scheme">(<span class="kw">define</span><span class="fu"> True </span>(λ () (λ (a b) (a))))
(<span class="kw">define</span><span class="fu"> False </span>(λ () (λ (a b) (b))))</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, <code>True</code> is a function which evaluates the first of its two arguments, and <code>False</code> is a function which evaluates the second of its two arguments.</p>
<p>So that we can display these values properly, I also define some helper procedures.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode scheme"><code class="sourceCode scheme">(define-syntax-rule (displayln str)
  (<span class="kw">display</span> (format
    (<span class="kw">string-append</span> str <span class="st">&quot;~n&quot;</span>))))

(<span class="kw">define</span><span class="fu"> </span>(show-bool b)
  (b (λ () (displayln <span class="st">&quot;True&quot;</span>))
     (λ () (displayln <span class="st">&quot;False&quot;</span>))))

(show-bool (True))
<span class="co">; &quot;True&quot;</span>

(show-bool (False))
<span class="co">; &quot;False&quot;</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="boolean-operators"><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> Boolean operators</h2>
<p>So far, so good. But what can we <em>do</em> with these values? Why, we can perform Boolean logic! Below I define <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode scheme"><code class="sourceCode scheme">(<span class="kw">define</span><span class="fu"> </span>(and/s p q)
  (p (λ() q) (λ() p)))

(<span class="kw">define</span><span class="fu"> </span>(or/s p q)
  (p (λ () p) (λ () q)))

(<span class="kw">define</span><span class="fu"> </span>(not/s b)
  (b False True))

(show-bool (and/s (True) (False)))
(show-bool (and/s (False) (True)))
(show-bool (and/s (True) (True)))
(show-bool (or/s (False) (True)))
(show-bool (or/s (True) (False)))
(show-bool (or/s (False) (False)))
(show-bool (not/s (and/s (False) (True))))</code></pre>
<h2 id="if-expressions"><span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> <code>if</code> expressions</h2>
<p>Ah, the part you've all been waiting for. First the code, then the explanation:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode scheme"><code class="sourceCode scheme">(define-syntax-rule (if/g condition then <span class="kw">else</span>)
  (<span class="kw">let</span> ((then-f (λ () then))
        (else-f (λ () <span class="kw">else</span>)))
    (condition then-f else-f)))

(if/g (True)
  (displayln <span class="st">&quot;Condition was true&quot;</span>)
  (displayln <span class="st">&quot;Condition was false&quot;</span>))

<span class="co">; &quot;Condition was true&quot;</span>

(if/g (False)
  (displayln <span class="st">&quot;Condition was true&quot;</span>)
  (displayln <span class="st">&quot;Condition was false&quot;</span>))

<span class="co">; &quot;Condition was false</span></code></pre>
<p><code>if/g</code> is defined as a macro because of how Scheme evaluates expressions. In normal functions, all arguments are evaluated before the function's value is computed.</p>
<p>In the case of an <code>if</code> conditional, though, the entire reason you want to use it is so that you can <em>not</em> evaluate certain expressions under certain conditions.</p>
<p>The solution to this is to write a <em>macro</em>. A macro is a procedure run during code compilation which does <strong>not</strong> evaluate its arguments by default. Instead, it returns a form which is literally pasted in place of the macro call, and the arguments are the unevaluated expressions it received, not their values.</p>
<p>So <code>functions</code> run at runtime, and <code>macros</code> run at compile time. Scheme provides an elegant mechanism for creating simple macros called <code>define-syntax-rule</code>. There are more complex but powerful ways to do this, with their own tradeoffs.</p>
<p>See if you can figure out why this macro is correct given what I have just told you.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue"><span class="header-section-number">0.4</span> Epilogue</h2>
<p>So you don't really need conditionals baked into your language. A question, though, is how expensive are these operations?</p>
<p>In a language like C, you can just use 1 or 0, which is stored compactly and efficiently, and you can simulate Boolean algebra with arithmetic algebra. Eg, <code>True AND False</code> &lt;=&gt; <code>1 * 0</code>.</p>
<p>With our method, a naive compiler would generate rather horrible code. However, if you think about it, a Boolean expression is a series of function applications which can theoretically be optimized extensively, and the data types themselves aren't so much actual data but control flow mechanisms themselves.</p>
<p>So, no concrete answer but this doesn't have to be a death sentence to efficiency.</p>
