# Well, what is cooperation?

Dictionaries lend some insight:

- Working with others toward the same end
- Assisting others
- A common effort

# Cooperation is that, as an economic strategy

>  - We all have some shared basic needs
>      - Food
>      - Shelter
>      - Wifi (?)
>  - Some of us have more complex needs as well
>      - Physical
>      - Financial
>      - Emotional
>  - And yet all too often problems go unsolved; needs aren't met.
>      - *Even though these problems aren't moon-shots!*

# How do tractable problems go unsolved?

>  - **Governance**
>      - Many people have limited or no voice in decisions affecting them
>  - **Economic participation**
>      - Renting one's life does not encourage stewardship (or allow it, in
>        some cases).
>  - **Division**
>      - Organizing is difficult and laborious on top of other
>        responsibilities.
>      - How do you know anyone will join?

---

# Cooperation is a model for collective empowerment

Skip the "if you can't beat 'em" part and **just join 'em!**

>  - Democratic member control
>  - Member economic participation
>  - Voluntary and open membership

# Cooperative housing puts the **YOU** in "US"

Cooperative housing is housing centered around these principles.

>  - Members meet and make decisions democratically
>  - Members pay dues and volunteer
>      - Collective ownership of profits
>      - Lowered costs: don't pay someone else to sweep!
>      - Encourages a sense of community and equality
>  - The community is inclusive and welcomes all who want to participate

*Sorry for the pun.*

# Enough waxing philosophic, how does this work?

# Enough waxing philosophic, how does this work? (cont'd)

Community Housing Expansion of Austin (CHEA)

>  - Founded in 2002 by former college coopers
>  - First house, Sasona, bought in south Austin

>        at a special meeting.

# And *does* it work?

Cooperation works!

>  - Rent is extremely low at both houses relative to surrounding market.
>  - Both houses are independently financially solvent.
>  - Houses are empowered to take care of themselves, and **they do.**
>      - No assembly of more than 1 person is ever going to be harmonious 24/7
>      - Cooperation is about *how* we deal with problems.
>  - "No [person] is an island." - John Donne
